## Coding
The first step, when you want to help with coding on the app, will be to setup your development environment.
We prepared a [page on the setup](setup) to help you get started with the technical requirements.

## Translating
Feel free to have a look at the [transifex page on the cookbook app](https://www.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/cookbook/).
Any translations done there will be synchronized on a nightly base.
