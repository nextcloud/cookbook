# Development documentation

This documentation should contain dedicated information about the Cookbook app.
No general information about the internals of the Nextcloud core should be published here as these tend to change and thus get dated.

Instead we want to reference the official documentation on [docs.nextcloud.com](https://docs.nextcloud.com), especially the development manual.

If you want to **help contributing**, please see the [page about contributing](contributing) for further information.
